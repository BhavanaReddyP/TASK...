#  Financial Transactions Anomaly Detection


**Objective:** Develop a system to identify and report anomalies in a dataset of financial transactions. This task will test your ability to implement complex logic for data analysis, handle large datasets, and integrate various data processing techniques within a coding environment.

### Task Description:

You will create a Python script that processes a large dataset of financial transactions to identify potential anomalies based on unusual patterns. The task involves reading the data, calculating statistical thresholds, and flagging transactions that deviate significantly from typical patterns.

### Requirements:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Load and preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and standardized.
    - Identify and handle missing or corrupt data entries.
2. **Statistical Analysis:**
    - Calculate basic statistical metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for transaction amounts by categories.
    - Establish thresholds for detecting outliers based on statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).
3. **Anomaly Detection:**
    - Implement logic to detect anomalies in transactions based on the thresholds established.
    - Anomalies could be unusually high transaction amounts, sudden frequency increases in transactions, or irregular patterns based on transaction history.
4. **Reporting:**
    - Generate a report listing all detected anomalies with details including transaction ID, date, amount, and reason for flagging as an anomaly.
    - Provide summary statistics on the number and types of anomalies detected.

### Sample Data:

Here's a hypothetical representation of the transaction dataset. This dataset includes the transaction ID, date, category, and amount.

```
transaction_id,date,category,amount
TRX001,2024-06-01,Food,25.00
TRX002,2024-06-01,Utilities,150.00
TRX003,2024-06-01,Entertainment,200.00
TRX004,2024-06-02,Food,3000.00  # Anomalous high amount
TRX005,2024-06-02,Transport,45.00
TRX006,2024-06-03,Utilities,135.00
TRX007,2024-06-03,Food,20.00

```

### Expected Output:

- A detailed report of anomalies including:
    - `transaction_id`
    - `date`
    - `category`
    - `amount`
    - `reason_for_anomaly` (e.g., "3 standard deviations above the mean")

### Deliverables:

1. **Python Script:** A fully functional Python script that reads the dataset, performs statistical analyses, detects anomalies, and outputs a detailed report.
2. **Anomaly Detection Logic:** Detailed implementation of anomaly detection logic that can accurately flag unusual transactions.
3. **Documentation:** Well-documented code explaining your methodology, assumptions, and the rationale behind chosen statistical methods and thresholds.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Complexity and Depth:** The task should reflect sophisticated logic and understanding of statistical methods for anomaly detection.
- **Accuracy and Thoroughness:** The output should accurately identify anomalies based on logical, statistical criteria.
- **Clarity, Documentation, and Code Quality:** Code should be clear, well-organized, and well-documented, making it easy for others to understand and maintain.
- **Innovation and Problem-Solving:** Creative and effective solutions to detect anomalies and handle large datasets efficiently.

This task is designed to mimic a real-world data analysis scenario in the financial sector, challenging candidates to apply complex logical and statistical concepts in a practical coding task.
